# Signature-Validation
* Developing a signature validation system using image processing techniques to authenticate handwritten signatures.
* The project involves preprocessing signatures, extracting key features, and comparing them against stored templates. Techniques like edge detection, contour analysis are used for accuracy.
* The system ensures secure and automated verification for banking, legal, and authentication applications.
* Results are displayed with confidence scores and validation status.

1. main.py is the main file used to run
2. Imports match function from signature.py
3. Add two signatures of your choice and check for similarity
